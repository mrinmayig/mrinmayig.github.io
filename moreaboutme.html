		<h2>Everyone Likes To Know Secrets</h2><br><br>
		<p>Hello, Dear Reader! First, let me thank you for investing your precious time in reading this section. I promise it will be more interesting than a static resume! It is a tiring task I know, who likes to read almost similar looking plain text? I appreciate your patience for reading so many resumes. Well, <strong>my resume is killing my creativity!</strong> It only shows what I have studied, what projects I have worked on and stuff. It fails to portray me as a person.</p><br><br>

		<p>To begin with, <strong>communicating with people is one of my strengths.</strong> I love to learn from people, I think it has been an important part in shaping my personality. I have explored different countries as a tourist before I enroled for a masters program here in the United States. Some of the countries I have visited are France, Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, and Thailand. I am a <strong>keen observer,</strong> I love nature.</p><br><br>

		<p>I am a <strong>graduate student actively scaling my learning abilities.</strong> I would not call myself a quick learner but rather a deep learner. I have interestedly completed my coursework in Probability and Statistics, Machine Learning and Deep Learning/Neural Networks. Currently, I am enroled in this really cool course called Large-Scale Analytics. I am actively working on my upcoming projects!</p><br><br>

		<p>My love for Machine Learning had just begun when I completed my coursework. But there is a way <strong>lot more to learn about Machine Learning</strong> than what I covered in coursework. I love to read and learn, I am attracted to books. Some of my favorites are Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville, The Elements of Statistical Learning by Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani and Trevor Hastie and Deep Learning with Python by François Chollet.</p><br><br>

		<p>I decided to look out for resources that would help me get better with Machine Learning. I wanted to learn how to apply <strong>Machine Learning in practice like, example, on 500 Terabytes of data.</strong> I "Googled", I found Google Cloud Platform. Whoa! I knew it would help me learn and I can use it in my upcoming projects. My friends asked if I was biased about the product. I was like maybe it is a "Naïve BIAS". I have deep respect for the AI community, <strong>I have assumed two "Virtual Mentors".</strong> I really respect Valliappa Lakshmanan (Lak) and his lectures on Data Engineering. I invest most of my time in learning more about Machine Learning and Data Engineering. I like Professor Andrew Ng's lectures.</p><br><br>

		<p>I feel I am analogous to a deep neural network, given more high-quality training examples, I tend to perform better. But wait, am I cross-validated? How well will I perform on the test set? To tune my hyperparameters, I decided to measure my performance by taking the <strong>Google Cloud Certified Data Engineer Exam.</strong> I don't want a certificate to show off my skills but instead I want it portray me as an active learner.</p><br><br>

		<p>Now, coming to seeking a job. Everyone wants a job, isn't it? There is a huge pool of talent out there, how am I different? No two people are alike, hence proved. I wanna keep getting better at my skills, I try to learn as much as I can by myself and through my "Virtual Mentors" but I need a "Real Mentor" to guide me on my way to perform better. I need a strong platform to learn from my peers and mentors. <strong>I wanna grow!</strong> :)</p><br><br>

		<p>There is a lot more to know about me, I will post it on my Medium account, but I'll end it short here. Coming to my technical skills and projects, I learn everyday and currently I am parallely working on multiple projects. I keep updating my work every week or as and when I complete. If you are reading this part, thank you! :) I know you are having a busy day and it <strong>really means a lot to me if you just read this!</strong></p><br><br>

		<p>Hello, Dear Reader! Since you are here let me share with you some fun facts about me!</p>
		<p>My name is Mrinmayi and most of my friends call me Myra for short.</p>
		<p>I am a highly enthusiastic graduate student pursuing a Master of Science degree with a specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Networks under the department of Electrical Engineering, at San Jose State University.</p>
		<p>I have a hands-on experience in designing and implementing end-to-end Machine Learning Systems, Deep Learning Solutions, performing Data Engineering and Data Science tasks along with Cloud Computing!</p>
		<p>Additionally, I love to dance, hit the gym, listen to music, read books, cook (and eat of course), talk to people and travel!</p>

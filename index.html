		<h3>Me talking about myself!</h3>
		<p>Hello, Dear Reader! Since you are here let me share with you some fun facts about me!</p><p>My name is Mrinmayi and most of my friends call me Myra for short.</p>I am a highly enthusiastic and happy graduate student at San José State University.</p>
		<p>I am passionate about learning new skills! I love to code in Python!</p>
		<p>I am really intrigued by Machine Learning, Data Engineering, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing!</p>
		<p>Additionally, I love to dance, hit the gym, listen to music, read books, cook (and eat of course), talk to people and travel!</p><p>I can make some really great sandwiches and bake butter cookies and chocolate brownie!</p>
		<p>Uh Oh! I have described only my academic projects in this portfolio but you can follow me on Instagram for more details on the cookies and the brownie!</p>
